# Face-Generation-GAN

In this project, we have used [generative adversarial network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) to generate new images of faces.
We have defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces.


We have used the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the adversarial networks. The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations.
